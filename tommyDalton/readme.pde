Brief description of the animation achieved: In this game you have to dodge two red squares which are moving towards you by pressing a key.
If the red squares hit the blue square the squares are reset and so is the score and a life will used.
The game will prompt your name and the amount of lives you wish to have.
The game will record and average your score at the end.


Known bugs/problems: Each the time the red squares reset the speed is increased by one. 
If you manage to survive long enough the red squares will go so fast they are no longer visible.
I see at as more of a feature than a bug.

Selecting cancel during the inputs for example during the nameing and life values will shut the program off with an error.
Similarly putting a negative value in place for the lives will also cause the game not to work also shutting it off with an error.
Or if an number is place inside the name section will also cause an issue with the string.

Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials):
